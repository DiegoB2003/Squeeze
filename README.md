# How To Play
You'll need to fulfill customer orders by stocking up on ingredients and crafting lemonade.
You may set prices of products after each day, but this will affect how customers respond to sales.
- Take Orders from customers who approach the lemonade stand by clicking "Take Order" over their head.
- Click "Buy Supplies" to buy ingredients from the shop to fulfill the orders in time.
- If you need to make Lemonade, you must craft it in the "Craft Menu". Click "Craft Menu" to open the craft menu.
- Crafting lemonade requires multiple ingredients. You can see the requirements in the craft menu.
- To close menus, click the red X on the upper right of the menu.
- Serve the customer by selecting the correct product in their order panel dropdown menu and then clicking the green check mark button.
- The customer will pay for the product and leave a review that depends on how you fulfilled the order. Maintain a high rating to get more customers each day.

This game was developed for an Undergraduate project at the University of Illinois at Chicago in a CS 442 course.
